        "  Copyright: Higher Education Office, Raffles Institution, 2022    3    PHILOSOPHY  Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions,  such as those concerning knowledge, reason, existence, truth,  values, mind, and language.   The word \u201cphilosophy\u201d comes from two Greek root words, philos  (meaning \u2018love\u2019) and sophia (meaning \u2018wisdom\u2019), thus,  philosophy means love of wisdom.     WHO WOULD ENJOY PHILOSOPHY?",
        " Students who enjoy questioning the fundamental nature of things might find Philosophy fascinating as it challenges our  understanding and assumptions of commonly accepted concepts and ideas. Common questions in Philosophy include,  how do we know that the world is real? Where does our idea of infinity come from?",
        "What is time? Are there absolute  moral standards or is everything relative? Is beauty only in the eyes of the beholder?",
        "Are we born with a natural number  sense? What is the connection between the brain and the mind? Do these questions intrigue you?",
        "Are you fascinated by  movies such as The Matrix, Inception, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Truman Show, or  Waking Life? If you are naturally curious about the essence of all sorts of things and find yourself reading up about these  in your free time, then Philosophy might just be for you.     WHAT DOES STUDYING PHILOSOPHY LOOK LIKE?",
        " Philosophers often love to talk about anything and everything, so you can expect to learn a bit of and read a lot about  everything. Be prepared to question and interact with tutors and peers on a wide range of topics. Philosophy is often  heavily essay-based, and may include independent research and dissertations towards the end of your degree.",
        "  Philosophy is a flexible degree that allows you to shape your  studies to your interest. There usually are foundation  modules introducing you to fundamental ideas and  arguments, such as logic. You will usually then be able to  choose what to study from a range of topics, such as ethics,  law, politics, science, social science, history, art, aesthetics,  language, religion, and so on.",
        "Sometimes, universities also  offer modules based on region, time, or culture, for example,  Ancient Chinese Philosophy.   WHERE CAN I STUDY PHILOSOPHY?  Many universities in the world offer Philosophy degrees at the undergraduate level.",
        "Philosophy can be taken as a single  degree or be combined with another subject, depending on the university offering this major. For example, in the UK, the  University of Cambridge only offers Philosophy as a single degree, but Durham University offers many interdisciplinary  Philosophy-related undergraduate degrees, such as Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Most universities in the USA offer  it in combination with other subjects, e.g. History, Philosophy and Theology.",
        "In Singapore, Philosophy can be pursued as  a single major in NTU, where students pursue a broad spectrum of modules ranging from World Religions, to Business  Ethics, to the philosophical study of the nature of love and friendship.  "

        "  Copyright: Higher Education Office, Raffles Institution, 2022    4    WHAT POSSIBLE PATHWAYS CAN A DEGREE IN THIS MAJOR LEAD TO?  Much of what is learned in Philosophy can be applied anywhere, as the skills acquired are transferable across many  disciplines. Studying Philosophy enhances one\u2019s general problem solving and critical thinking skills (especially in analysing  concepts, definitions, arguments and problems), communication skills and persuasive powers (especially in presenting  ideas through well-constructed arguments and in appreciating competing positions), and writing skills.",
        "A Philosophy  major would thus qualify for any job that places a strong emphasis on these skills.   Reading Philosophy also enhances one\u2019s ability to understand other disciplines, since many important questions about a  discipline are philosophical in nature (such as its nature, concepts, and knowledge construction). It also contributes to  the development of sound methods of research and analysis, since the philosopher has to appropriately frame  hypotheses, put problems in manageable form, conduct research, analyse evaluate data to confirm or deny hypotheses,  all the while thinking critically about the criteria necessary for judging the success and failure of research methods.",
        "For  example, philosophers often help the medical field when considering the ethical concerns involving patients and/or  treatment options. In the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), more firms are hiring philosophers into \u2018Chief  Ethics Officer\u2019 roles to look into AI-related output through a human lens.   In recent times, philosophy graduates have also proven to be a ticket into the tech industry \u2013 the co-founder and CEO of  Slack, Stewart Butterfield, holds undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees in Philosophy.",
        "Tech firms today welcome  Philosophy graduates who are able to think and express themselves clearly, and are focused enough to pursue a single  line of argument \u2013 highly relevant skills that bridge hard-core engineers with sales-focused customers.   Notable individuals who studied Philosophy at university include former Pope John Paul II, former US President Bill Clinton,  co-founder of PayPal Peter Thiel, co-founder of Wikipedia Larry Sanger, business magnate and philanthropist George  Soros, Nobel prize-winning novelist Pearl S Buck, Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley Mclachlin, actors Susan  Sarandon, Harrison Ford, and Richard Gere, and Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi.

Psychologists may study a range of subjects, from the behaviour  of a single brain cell, to how individuals interact with one  another in dyadic or group settings, and variations in behaviours  across cultures. Topics include abnormal, biological, cognitive,  developmental, and social psychology.",
        "    WHO WOULD ENJOY PSYCHOLOGY?  Students who are fascinated with the workings of the human brain and how it affects behaviour, cognition, and emotions  may find Psychology interesting. Common questions examined in Psychology include, which is more important for  development - nature or nurture?",

What are some intervention methods and policies that can be implemented to improve  physical and mental health across different settings (e.g., hospitals, schools, organisations) and age groups (e.g., children,  adolescents, adults)? If you are interested in several topics across different areas (e.g., Neurophysiology, Statistics,  Sociology), you may be drawn to Psychology because of its highly interdisciplinary nature.",
        "    WHAT DOES STUDYING PSYCHOLOGY LOOK LIKE?  Students can either choose to pursue a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor  of Science or a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology. A  Bachelor of Science degree is pursued if you are interested in  gaining a deeper understanding of research, the workings of the  brain and how it impacts behaviour, and/or statistical  methodology.",
        "Students who are interested in getting involved in  research can work with a faculty member as a research assistant.  In contrast, a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology may focus more on  other aspects, such as organisational behaviour, and the study of  consumerism and how people make choices. Regardless of which  option you select, all students who are interested in majoring in Psychology would need to take Introduction to  Psychology before completing any core modules.",
        "Students will also be required to take at least one course on research  methods and statistics. Each university has its own requirements and modules that students have to complete depending  on whether you are fulfilling a Bachelor of Arts, Science, or Social Sciences degree. At the end of the programme, students  may be required to complete an undergraduate capstone project or thesis that may be in the format of either a research  project or a review paper.",
        "  Students who are interested in specialising in a specific area of Psychology (e.g., Clinical, Developmental, Industrial- Organisational, Cognitive) may choose to enrol in a graduate degree programme. This ranges from pursuing a master\u2019s  degree in Counselling Psychology to completing a doctoral degree in Industrial-Organisational Psychology.    "

        "Once students have completed the core courses  required for their major, they can select electives on topics that they are interested in. Due to the highly interdisciplinary  nature of Psychology, some universities may offer programmes with specific majors related to Psychology. For example,  the University of Edinburgh in the UK offers an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science.",
        "Purdue University in the US  offers two types of majors related to Psychology: Psychological Sciences, and Brain and Behavioural Sciences. In Singapore,  Psychology can be studied as a single major in NTU, or as a major within the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences at the College  of Humanities and Sciences (CHS) at NUS. At SMU, students who pursue a Bachelor of Social Science degree can choose  to join the Psychology, Political Science or Sociology (PPS) interdisciplinary programme, where they can choose to focus  on one of the three majors eventually (i.e., Psychology, Political Science, and Sociology).",
        " WHAT POSSIBLE PATHWAYS CAN A DEGREE IN THIS MAJOR LEAD TO?  Psychology graduates who have a firm grasp of and interest in scientific research in Psychology, such as psychometric  testing and statistical analysis, can explore jobs that are more clinical in nature, involving clinical assessments,  administering, scoring, and interpretation of standardised tests. Graduates who prefer to deal with patient diagnosis and  recovery can consider jobs in counselling, therapy, social services and education, such as sports psychologist, educational  psychologist, or substance abuse counsellor.",
        "  Graduates who prefer not to be in clinical settings can consider organisational or business settings where psychology is  applied, such as in Human Resource, Marketing and Advertising, Market Research, and Industrial and Organisational  Psychology, dealing with issues such as employee placement, productivity and motivation, as well as consumer purchase  decisions. Psychology graduates are also well placed to advise policy and strategy decisions as they leverage Psychology  theories and methods to enhance decision-making. For example, the Ministry of Defence offers roles in Defence  Psychology, engaging psychologists to guide strategic communications strategy, policy and planning, and develop  frameworks and models to help the Ministry gain in-depth understanding of defence-related issues.",
        "Similar roles are  available for psychologists in other Ministries, such as in Education, Home Affairs, and Social and Family Development.   Because reading Psychology equips the graduate with knowledge of scientific research and its associated methods, as  well as tools for interpreting data and information related to human behavioural and mental processes, there are multiple  pathways in social scientific and business fields open to Psychology majors. The eventual job fit will depend on the  graduate\u2019s skill set, personality, and aptitude for the given role.",
        " Notable individuals who majored in Psychology include celebrity television producer Jerry Bruckheimer, actress Natalie  Portman, stand-up comedian and television host Jon Stewart, and chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon.  Examples of Singaporean Psychology majors who pursued non-clinical pathways include Danielle Tay, recruiting  coordinator for Facebook (Singapore), Subir Roy, Human Resource Advisor at UBS AG (Singapore), and Angela Lim, news  anchor at Channel 5.

Students with a Liberal Arts degree will be given opportunities to hone and  develop their analytical skills across the sciences and the arts.",
