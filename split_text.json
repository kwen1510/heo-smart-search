The word \u201cphilosophy\u201d comes from two Greek root words, philos  (meaning \u2018love\u2019) and sophia (meaning \u2018wisdom\u2019), thus,  philosophy means love of wisdom.     WHO WOULD ENJOY PHILOSOPHY?",
        " Students who enjoy questioning the fundamental nature of things might find Philosophy fascinating as it challenges our  understanding and assumptions of commonly accepted concepts and ideas. Common questions in Philosophy include,  how do we know that the world is real? Where does our idea of infinity come from?",
        "What is time? Are there absolute  moral standards or is everything relative? Is beauty only in the eyes of the beholder?",
        "Are we born with a natural number  sense? What is the connection between the brain and the mind? Do these questions intrigue you?",
        "Are you fascinated by  movies such as The Matrix, Inception, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Truman Show, or  Waking Life? If you are naturally curious about the essence of all sorts of things and find yourself reading up about these  in your free time, then Philosophy might just be for you.     WHAT DOES STUDYING PHILOSOPHY LOOK LIKE?",
        " Philosophers often love to talk about anything and everything, so you can expect to learn a bit of and read a lot about  everything. Be prepared to question and interact with tutors and peers on a wide range of topics. Philosophy is often  heavily essay-based, and may include independent research and dissertations towards the end of your degree.",
        "  Philosophy is a flexible degree that allows you to shape your  studies to your interest. There usually are foundation  modules introducing you to fundamental ideas and  arguments, such as logic. You will usually then be able to  choose what to study from a range of topics, such as ethics,  law, politics, science, social science, history, art, aesthetics,  language, religion, and so on.",
        "Sometimes, universities also  offer modules based on region, time, or culture, for example,  Ancient Chinese Philosophy.   WHERE CAN I STUDY PHILOSOPHY?  Many universities in the world offer Philosophy degrees at the undergraduate level.",
        "Philosophy can be taken as a single  degree or be combined with another subject, depending on the university offering this major. For example, in the UK, the  University of Cambridge only offers Philosophy as a single degree, but Durham University offers many interdisciplinary  Philosophy-related undergraduate degrees, such as Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Most universities in the USA offer  it in combination with other subjects, e.g. History, Philosophy and Theology.",
        "In Singapore, Philosophy can be pursued as  a single major in NTU, where students pursue a broad spectrum of modules ranging from World Religions, to Business  Ethics, to the philosophical study of the nature of love and friendship.  "

        "  Copyright: Higher Education Office, Raffles Institution, 2022    4    WHAT POSSIBLE PATHWAYS CAN A DEGREE IN THIS MAJOR LEAD TO?  Much of what is learned in Philosophy can be applied anywhere, as the skills acquired are transferable across many  disciplines. Studying Philosophy enhances one\u2019s general problem solving and critical thinking skills (especially in analysing  concepts, definitions, arguments and problems), communication skills and persuasive powers (especially in presenting  ideas through well-constructed arguments and in appreciating competing positions), and writing skills.",
        "A Philosophy  major would thus qualify for any job that places a strong emphasis on these skills.   Reading Philosophy also enhances one\u2019s ability to understand other disciplines, since many important questions about a  discipline are philosophical in nature (such as its nature, concepts, and knowledge construction). It also contributes to  the development of sound methods of research and analysis, since the philosopher has to appropriately frame  hypotheses, put problems in manageable form, conduct research, analyse evaluate data to confirm or deny hypotheses,  all the while thinking critically about the criteria necessary for judging the success and failure of research methods.",
        "For  example, philosophers often help the medical field when considering the ethical concerns involving patients and/or  treatment options. In the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), more firms are hiring philosophers into \u2018Chief  Ethics Officer\u2019 roles to look into AI-related output through a human lens.   In recent times, philosophy graduates have also proven to be a ticket into the tech industry \u2013 the co-founder and CEO of  Slack, Stewart Butterfield, holds undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees in Philosophy.",
        "Tech firms today welcome  Philosophy graduates who are able to think and express themselves clearly, and are focused enough to pursue a single  line of argument \u2013 highly relevant skills that bridge hard-core engineers with sales-focused customers.   Notable individuals who studied Philosophy at university include former Pope John Paul II, former US President Bill Clinton,  co-founder of PayPal Peter Thiel, co-founder of Wikipedia Larry Sanger, business magnate and philanthropist George  Soros, Nobel prize-winning novelist Pearl S Buck, Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley Mclachlin, actors Susan  Sarandon, Harrison Ford, and Richard Gere, and Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi.

If you are interested in several topics across different areas (e.g., Neurophysiology, Statistics,  Sociology), you may be drawn to Psychology because of its highly interdisciplinary nature.",

In contrast, a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology may focus more on  other aspects, such as organisational behaviour, and the study of  consumerism and how people make choices.

Graduates who prefer to deal with patient diagnosis and  recovery can consider jobs in counselling, therapy, social services and education, such as sports psychologist, educational  psychologist, or substance abuse counsellor.",
        "  Graduates who prefer not to be in clinical settings can consider organisational or business settings where psychology is  applied, such as in Human Resource, Marketing and Advertising, Market Research, and Industrial and Organisational  Psychology, dealing with issues such as employee placement, productivity and motivation, as well as consumer purchase  decisions. Psychology graduates are also well placed to advise policy and strategy decisions as they leverage Psychology  theories and methods to enhance decision-making. For example, the Ministry of Defence offers roles in Defence  Psychology, engaging psychologists to guide strategic communications strategy, policy and planning, and develop  frameworks and models to help the Ministry gain in-depth understanding of defence-related issues.",
        "Similar roles are  available for psychologists in other Ministries, such as in Education, Home Affairs, and Social and Family Development.   Because reading Psychology equips the graduate with knowledge of scientific research and its associated methods, as  well as tools for interpreting data and information related to human behavioural and mental processes, there are multiple  pathways in social scientific and business fields open to Psychology majors. The eventual job fit will depend on the  graduate\u2019s skill set, personality, and aptitude for the given role.",

        " Do you enjoy having the option to choose from a variety of subjects across many disciplines? Does learning how  knowledge can be applied to different areas intrigue you? Do you find yourself having a hard time deciding whether to  pursue a degree in the humanities, arts, social sciences, or science?",

        " In a liberal arts curriculum, students will study courses across a broad basket of  disciplines (e.g., in humanities, social sciences, and creative arts) instead of a  specific field. The value of a Liberal Arts degree is that it equips you with broad and  diverse skills (e.g., effective communication, critical thinking etc.) useful for any  occupation as well as general knowledge, rather than skills relevant for a specific  job. Students with a Liberal Arts degree will be given opportunities to hone and  develop their analytical skills across the sciences and the arts.",
        "This will be useful for  navigating questions that arise across several disciplines and integrating  information across these areas. This is highly relevant in the modern workplace,  where careers often require a range of interdisciplinary skills.  WHERE CAN I STUDY LIBERAL ARTS?",

        "Compared to most public universities,  Liberal Arts colleges have a smaller student population. Since class sizes are smaller (on average 15 to 20 students per  class), classes are mostly discussion-based instead of the traditional instruction style (i.e., listening to the professor giving  a lecture in a large lecture hall).

Accountants generally process and communicate financial and  non-financial information about businesses or corporations to  the management, facilitating decision-making at the  management level.       Why Accountancy?",
        " In the age of big data, with analytics, automation and accounting data becoming increasingly integral to the business  strategies of corporations and accounting firms, the accountants\u2019 ability to handle complex data sets, analyse financial  trends and maintain financial accounts based on accounting principles becomes essential.  Does the sight of numbers send your heart palpitating with excitement? Are you gifted with an exceptional ability to see  and analyse patterns in complex sets of data?",
        "Do you pride yourself in having an eye for details and possessing the ability  to communicate relevant information with accuracy and clarity via various media? If you are already intrigued by now,  then Accountancy might be for you!  What does the study of Accountancy entail?",
        " While those applying to study accounting/accountancy are usually required to demonstrate a strong background in  mathematics, accountancy undergraduates are generally exposed to a holistic education that is broad-based with a  strong accounting core drawing from fields such as information technology, law, statistics, business and economics. It is  important to realise that with the rapid evolution of the industry, what Accountancy is today is not what it was in the  past.  In short, Accountancy is a multi-disciplinary subject that involves learning how to measure, process, analyse and  communicate financial information about an organisation to a variety of concerned parties, which include investors,  management teams and regulators, in order to facilitate improvement and adherence to established rules and guidelines.",
        " Accountancy graduates tend to be professionals who are not only technically competent but who also possess high ethical  standards and good business acumen, on top of being technologically savvy.   Most accounting degrees are accredited by relevant professional bodies for accountants at the national level. Some  examples include the UK-based Association of Chartered and Certified Accountants, Institute of Financial Accountants  and Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants based in the  US as well as the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants.",

At NUS, the main distinction here is that the BBA (Acc) programme is the BBA programme with an extended accountancy  component.

In addition to this rigorous core curriculum, students read a combination of core modules  in Accounting and Business, and electives in Accounting as well as courses from other faculties.  The study of Accountancy at SMU and NTU allows the flexibility to read a 2nd Major in addition to Accountancy.",

The 3 main aims of econometrics are: to formulate and specify  econometric models, to estimate and test these models and finally to make  use of these models   for forecasting and policy formulation.",
        "    What does studying Econometrics entail?  The study of econometrics entails the use of statistical methods to quantify and analyse economic theories by leveraging  tools such as frequency and probability distributions, statistical inference, correlation and regression analysis, and time  series methods. Hence, an excellent performance in H2 Mathematics at the GCE \u2018A\u2019 levels tends to be a prerequisite to  the study of econometrics.",
        "Students who thrive in this course are those who love numbers and modelling, and can  envision and translate how theory is applied to practical situations in the real world. Generally, Econometrics is not  studied in isolation, but is often twinned with related majors such as Economics or Mathematics, or is offered as a  specialisation within the Economics and Business majors. Students interested in this specialisation can also refer to the  Arts Majors guide (Economics) or the STEM Majors guide (Mathematics) for more information.",
        "    Where can I study Econometrics?  Locally, econometrics is not offered as a standalone major,  but is offered at the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences (FASS)  in NUS as one of the compulsory modules that an  Economics major would have to undertake, in the pursuit  of the Bachelor of Social Sciences (BSc) with Honours  (Hons) in Economics. At the School of Social Sciences (SSS)  in NTU, econometrics and its associated modules such as  econometric modelling & forecasting can be taken as  minors in the pursuit of the BSc (Hons) in Economics.",
